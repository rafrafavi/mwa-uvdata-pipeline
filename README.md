# MWA Demo Pipeline

Proposes a pipeline API for MWA (Murchison Widefield Array) data processing used in MWA Demo.

The key objectives are to:

- Provide a simple and easy-to-use interface for MWA data processing.
- Place reusable code in a common library following Python packaging standards.
- Provide performance monitoring.
- Protect peak memory usage through automated batching.

## Install it from PyPI

Intended to be installable from PyPI (TBD)

```

## Usage
